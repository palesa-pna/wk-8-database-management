# Library Management System ðŸ“š

## Description

This project is a relational database system designed for managing a library's book inventory, members, borrowing records, and administrative staff. It uses MySQL to define and enforce relationships between entities such as books, members, authors, and loans.

The system is designed to:

* Track library members and their borrowing history
* Manage book records, including copies and authors
* Enforce data integrity with foreign keys and constraints
* Provide a solid base for building a library management application

## How to Run / Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-db.git
```

2. **Open MySQL or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench**

3. **Run the SQL script**:

* Locate the file `library_management.sql`
* Execute it in your SQL environment

This will:

* Create a database named `library_management`
* Create all required tables with proper constraints and relationships
